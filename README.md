# Program Payments Visualization Project

## Project Overview

This project is a web application designed to visualize Medicare Program Payments data from 2015-2020. It provides an interactive and mobile-friendly interface for users to explore trends in Medicare spending through various levels of care and sites of service. The application is built with the aim of making Medicare spending data accessible and understandable to a broad audience.

## Data Storage

The data for the Program Payments visualization is stored on AWS database servers. Utilizing AWS ensures the application benefits from high availability, reliability, and scalability, which are crucial for managing and processing large datasets efficiently.

## Program Payments Page

The focal point of my contribution to this project is the Program Payments page. This page features interactive charts that display the trend of Medicare spending over the years, with functionalities allowing users to filter the data for more detailed insights. Users can select different levels of care to visualize spending trends and compare them across the available years.

### Features

- Interactive charts displaying spending trends for Medicare Program Payments from 2015-2020.
- Multi-select filters for users to view detailed breakdowns of spending per level of care.
- Data sorted and presented in tables for easy understanding and analysis.

## Technical Implementation and Deployment

### Frontend
- **Technology:** JavaScript along with visualization libraries for interactive chart creation.
- **Features:** Interactive charts displaying trends, multi-select filters for detailed insights, and data presentation in sortable tables.

### Backend
- **Data Storage:** The application's data is stored on AWS database servers, ensuring efficient management and processing of large datasets.
- **Server Technology:** ColdFusion and Lucee were used as the server-side technologies to handle data processing and serve the web application. This choice provided a robust and scalable environment for deploying web applications with complex data processing needs.

### Deployment
- **Platform:** The application was deployed using ColdFusion and Lucee, highlighting the project's reliance on these technologies for server-side scripting and application delivery. This deployment strategy was chosen for its reliability and performance in web application hosting.
